# FCC-Build-a-Availability-Table

-refined table building skills and was tricky initially trying to get the 9am header but didn't realize it was with the overall first row and spaned 2 rows. Everything else also spaned two rows as the picture did show two rows were being taken.
- Utilizing variables and using them consistently making my CSS was less than necessary.
- Was little tricky getting the availablity legend to center with the other context but made a box within it and used display: flex. Also overlooked text-align as well.
- probably hardest part was getting the inital table setup as I forgot abotu row/col span and that was what I needed. That was pretty much it and then a little bit on the available legend to center but that was more than FCC wanted me to do it a certain way which was pretty annoying. 



<h2>Finished (I can refine it but its just a FCC project and just praciticing and just getting the main points across as the lesson was about variables.)</h2>
